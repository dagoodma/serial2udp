# serial2udp

This program converts a serial port into a UDP port via software. It is a multi-threaded app that reads/writes from both a serial port and a UDP port merely passing the data through. It is used for various autonomous systems projects that require interfacing with Simulink to avoid issues that the serial port has on some platforms.

## License/distribution

This project follows the terms of the Mozilla Public License v2.0. Any distribution of the source code of this project must follow those licensing terms.

## Usage

This program is GUI-less and runs directly from the command line. Details on available options is available when running with '-h' or '--help' as arguments.

NOTE: You should specify a packet size for both the serial and UDP lines to get optimal performance. This will specify how many bytes the program waits for before triggering an interrupt on the serial side. On the UDP
side it must be larger than the largest expected UDP datagram size otherwise the program may not work properly.

## Building

#### Windows 64-bit

Prerequisites:
 - Compiler: Only tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
 - Boost library 

### Install Boost (http://www.boost.org/)
1. Download the Boost library from boost.org
2. Extract the library to C:\boost_1_48_0_x64 (changing 1_48 to whatever your version is)
3. (Following the build instructions for x86-64 1.48) Open a command prompt and enter the root directory of the Boost files.
4. Run `bootstrap.bat`
5. Compile for x86-64 by running `bjam msvc-10.0 variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static architecture=x86 address-mode=64-bit --stage-dir=stage64`
  - This will build only the multi-threaded statically-linked release build that is necessary for this project. If you'd like to use this Boost installation for debugging or other projects you'll probably want to just build everything by switching out the 'variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static' options for '--build-type=complete' instead.

### Building the program

I have only tested this program on 64-bit Windows and as such have no instructions for compiling on other platforms. This program only relies on standard library functions as well as the cross-platform C++ library Boost and as such should be retargetable to many platforms.

I only include instructions for building this project for x64 as that is my primary target. This code should compile for x86 if you have the x86 build of Boost available.

1. Create a new MSVC++ 2010 Win32 Console Application project
  - Specify Empty Project within the wizard
2. Modify the project to add the root Boost folder ('C:\boost_1_48_0_x64' if following the above instructions) to the header path
  - Properties->C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories
3. Modify the project to use the static non-debug version of the Boost library 
  - Properties->C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime Library
4. Modify the project to add the Boost libraries for linking ('C:\boost_1_48_x64\stage64\lib\' if following the above instructions)
  - Properties->C/C++->Linker->General->Additional Library Directories
5. Disable use of precompiled headers
  - Set Properties->C/C++->Precompiled Headers to 'Not Using Precompiled Headers'
6. Set compilation for a statically-linked multi-threaded library
  - Set Properties->C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime Library to 'Multi-threaded (/MT)'
7. Specify building for an x64 release target
  - Build->Configuration Manager->Active Solution Platform->New...->OK
  - Under 'Platform'  select the new x64 target.
  - Under 'Configuration' select 'Release'
8. Build it
  - Ctrl-Shift-B or Build->Build Solution
9. Run it
  - The executeable will be in '/x64/Release/'


#### Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) 32-bit (i386)

Prerequisites:
 - Compiler: Only tested with g++
 - Boost library 

### Install Boost (http://www.boost.org/)

Installing Boost with a package manager such as MacPorts, Fink, or Homebrew should also work, but I kept seeing 'unsupported file format' warnings and undefined symbols when attempting to link the Boost libraries. Thus it is recommended to build Boost from source:

1. Download the Boost library from boost.org
2. Extract the library to a folder in your user directory (ie. ~/Downloads)
3. (Following the build instructions for x86 1.50) Open a terminal window (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and change to the root directory where you extracted the Boost files.
4. Run `./bootstrap.sh`
5. Compile for x86 by running `sudo ./b2 variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static architecture=x86`
  - This will build only the multi-threaded statically-linked release build that is necessary for this project. Also, I was seeing permission denied messages without 'sudo'.

### Building the program

I have only tested this program on 32-bit Snow Leopard, but should be retargetable to other versions of Mac OS X.

1. In a terminal window change into the directory where 'serial2udp.cpp' is.
2. Compile the program
  - Run `g++ -v -m32 -I/Users/me/Downloads/boost_1_50_0 serial2udp.cpp -o serial2udp -L/Users/me/Downloads/boost_1_50_0/stage/lib -lboost_program_options -lboost_date_time -lboost_system`
3. Run it
  - The binary is called 'serial2udp'
