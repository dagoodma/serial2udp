// ==============================================================
// This code provides a protocol decoder for the binary communications
// protocol used between the groundstation/HIL and the dsPIC in
// the Autoboat project. As most programming relies on Simulink and
// the Real-Time Workshop, retrieval functions here return arrays of
// data to be compatible (instead of much-nicer structs).
// A complete structure is passed byte-by-byte and assembled in an 
// internal buffer. This is then verified by its checksum and the 
//data pushed into the appropriate struct. This data can then be 
// retrieved via an accessor function.
//
// While this code was written specifically for the Autoboat and its
// protocol, it has been kept as modular as possible to be useful
// in other situations with the most minimal alterations.
